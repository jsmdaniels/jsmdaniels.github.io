title: What to think about when thinking about diabetes management?
---

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterised by insufficient or complete lack of regulation of blood glucose concentration levels. Individuals with diabetes can experience adverse glycaemic events without intervention that can lead to loss of consciousness or death in the short-term and, over the long-term, result in complications such as diabetic retinopathy. As one of four major chronic diseases, diabetes is estimated to affect 400 million people around the world currently, with trends projecting an increase in prevalence in the future [^1]. Beyond the loss in quality of life to the individual, diabetes also exacts direct and indirect costs on society and remains a significant burden on healthcare systems.
