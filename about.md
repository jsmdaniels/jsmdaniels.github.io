Hi There! My name is John Daniels. I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology, Imperial College London. My research is currently focused on machine learning for healthcare in the areas of chronic disease (such as diabetes) and infectious disease (such as dengue) management. For a deeper look into my research, see [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=TGzM-T8AAAAJ).

### More Information
The blog will mainly feature details on the some of the work I am involved in, and in other ideas in my areas of nterest. Currently interested in the following areas: uncertainty quantification, model compression, generative models, and causal inference.
