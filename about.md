Hi There! My name is John Daniels. My research is focused on machine learning for healthcare in the areas of chronic disease (such as diabetes) and infectious disease (such as dengue) management. For a deeper look into my research, see [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=TGzM-T8AAAAJ).

### More Information
The blog will mainly feature details on the some of the work I am involved in, and interaction of this technology with wider society. I'm currently interested in the following areas: uncertainty quantification, multitask learning, multimodal learning, generative models, and model compression.
